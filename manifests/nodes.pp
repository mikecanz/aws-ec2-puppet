# webserver                     Basic webserver that might use some other data store or may just not need one
#
# devserver|mysql-webserver     Servers that include mysql.  We have two types because webserver will just 
#                               have ports 80 and 443 open while the devserver will also have port 22.
#
# admin                         Admin and build machine.  If one wants to ssh into a webserver they need
#                               to go through this machine.  Also hosts the private yum repo
